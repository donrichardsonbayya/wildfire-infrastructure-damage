# Linking Wildfire Risk with Infrastructure Damage  
**Business Challenge II â€“ MBAN Program**

This project investigates the link between wildfire intensity (via Fire Weather Index - FWI) and resulting infrastructure damage across five high-risk European countries: **Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Greece**. It combines **dynamic data engineering, geospatial analysis, and machine learning** to support proactive disaster planning.

---

##  Summary of Business Problem

As climate events grow in frequency and severity, governments and insurers must better understand the drivers of infrastructure damage from wildfires. Using wildfire data from 2012â€“2024, this study examines how **climate risk metrics like FWI** correlate with infrastructure vulnerability and damage severity.

##  Key Features

### ðŸ”„ Dynamic Data Engineering
- Programmatically constructs web URLs to **automatically download event-level wildfire data** by country and year (no static datasets required).
- Cleans and structures multiple JSON/CSV sources into a unified, analysis-ready format.

###  Geospatial Analysis with Shapefiles
- Leverages country-level **shapefiles** to map infrastructure, wildfire zones, and **WUI (Wildland-Urban Interface)** labels.
- Performs spatial joins to assess **infrastructure type** (`obj_type`) and exposure to fire-prone areas.

### Predictive Modeling & EDA
- Investigates patterns in **damage_grade vs. FWI** with box plots and correlation analysis.
- Trains:
  - **Logistic Regression**: for binary classification of severe vs. low/no damage.
  - **Random Forest**: to improve accuracy and handle nonlinearity.
- Visualizes `obj_type` and `wui_label` distribution to identify high-risk infrastructures.

---

##  Business Insights (from Final Report)

- **FWI is a strong predictor** of higher infrastructure damage grades (Grades 3â€“5).
- The most vulnerable object types include:
  - Power grid stations
  - Transportation hubs
  - Telecommunication nodes
- France shows **higher correlation** between fire risk and severe damage than other countries.
- Including **WUI classification** improves geographic targeting of high-risk zones.
- The Random Forest model outperforms logistic regression in **predictive performance**.

---

##  Stakeholder Recommendations

- Public authorities should **integrate climate indicators (FWI)** into infrastructure resilience planning.
- Focus fire prevention funding on **WUI-adjacent critical infrastructure**.
- Use model insights to inform **early warning systems** and **insurance pricing**.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `requests`
- **Dynamic ingestion**: programmatically pulls JSON/CSV from structured URLs
- **GIS**: shapefile integration, spatial joins, and region-wise fire mapping
- **Machine Learning**: binary classification (logistic regression & random forest)

---

##  Data Notes

- No static CSVs â€” all data is **downloaded dynamically** via parameterized URL templates.
- **Shapefiles** are essential for mapping infrastructure to WUI zones and country boundaries.
- Data spans **2012â€“2024**, including over **100,000+ infrastructure entries**.
